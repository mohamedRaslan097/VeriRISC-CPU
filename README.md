# VeriRISC-CPU
The VeriRISC model is a very-reduced-instruction-set processor coded in the Verilog HDL. Its instruction consists of a three-bit operation code and a five-bit operand. That restricts its instruction set to eight instructions and its address space to 32 locations

## HOW TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE PROJECT
each folder contains the RTL code for each unit, it's test-bench and snipshots from the simulation of this testbenchs
